# Picker
### This is an images/gifs and coubs picker from joyreactor and some of its subdomains. With a help of it you can download media from a particular post or download all media from a chosen category with only one command.

## Usage:

To use a picker script, just open a console and type

`python *path to script*/Picker http://link_to_post/category.сс`

>Script will automatically create a folder with the domain name.


After downloading all necessary media, you can organize them with **images_concentrator**. Open a console and type

`python *path to script*/images_concentrator -a (all files)/ -g (only gifs)/ -i (only images)/ -c (only coubs)`

>Choose an argument for the media type you want to work with


**Tasks to work on:**
- [ ] Solve the temporary IP ban
- [ ] Style the downloading process output
- [ ] Eat a cake when all tasks are done :tada:
